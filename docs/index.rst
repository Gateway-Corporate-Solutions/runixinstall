runixinstall Documentation
=========================

**runixinstall** is library which can be used to install Arch Linux.
The library comes packaged with different pre-configured installers, such as the default :ref:`guided` installer.

Some of the features of runixinstall are:

* **Context friendly.** The library always executes calls in sequential order to ensure installation-steps don't overlap or execute in the wrong order. It also supports *(and uses)* context wrappers to ensure cleanup and final tasks such as ``mkinitcpio`` are called when needed.

* **Full transparency** Logs and insights can be found at ``/var/log/runixinstall`` both in the live ISO and partially on the installed system.

* **Accessibility friendly** runixinstall works with ``espeakup`` and other accessibility tools thanks to the use of a TUI.
